There are 3 steps to recreate the results of the paper

# 1. Access the data

The recreation data comes from the Canadian Nature Survey available here
 https://biodivcanada.chm-cbd.net/documents/canadian-nature-survey

The recreation dataset is available to download here
 https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/694b9da8-1f06-4ebe-ad38-1b14bdaf756e

Save the cns2012pumf.xlsx file as Raw2012Data.csv in the data/raw folder
 
# 2. Clean and create data sets for analysis

- You will need to install the following R packages

install.packages("pacman", "tidyverse", "mice", "fastDummies", "furrr", 
				"micemd", "randtoolbox", "rstan", "rmdcev")

- Run the 1PrepareData.R script
- Not that this script involves intensive data imputation and takes a long time to run on a desktop computer (~48 hours on a desktop computer with 32 GB RAM).

# 3. Conduct the analysis and create all the tables/figures in paper

- Run the 2RunAnalysis R script
